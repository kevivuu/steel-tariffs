# The Impact of US - Canada Steel Import Tariffs on the Returns of Steel: An Event Study
This is my undergrad Finance thesis for my International Economics degree in UBC. I study the impact that some important events surrounding the 2018 steel tariffs, which US imposed on Canada (and Mexico), had on the daily returns of major steel companies in both countries. The thesis was motivated by the recent 25% import tariff which Donald Trump imposed on most goods and services in Canada. The results shows that there were significant impacts in some events, although not all of them, indicating that there are consequences for investors of certain commodity markets regarding the trade policies of that market.

Please view the PDF attached above for the full thesis. Thank you! :)
